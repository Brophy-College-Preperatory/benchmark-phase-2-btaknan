            <h2>Religion</h2>
            <p>Last of all, Brophy being the only Jesuit high school in Arizona, is a school very deeply rooted in their religion. Every Sunday during the school year, a Mass is held at Brophy Chapel welcoming all members of the community. The chapel was built in 1928 and is also used sacred events like weddings, baptisms, and funerals. Their weddings are limited to Brophy and Xavier graduates. The school’s mission is based on their Jesuit values of caring for the poor and oppressed, inspired by Jesus’ words in Luke 4:18-19. Being committed to service and faith is a central idea at Brophy. </p>
