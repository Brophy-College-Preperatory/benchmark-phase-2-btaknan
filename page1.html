            <p>Brophy was founded in 1928 by by Ellen A. Brophy in memory of her late husband William Henry Brophy. It was supposed to be a Jesuit college, but it started as a high school. The school had money problems during the Great Depression and closed in 1935, then reopened in 1952. Today, Brophy is a prestigious school in Phoenix with about 1,400 students and the campus still has it's original Spanish Colonial style. All in all, the history of Brophy's founding and motive brings it to what it now is. </p>
